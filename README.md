# articunointern

A demo project for Articuno Coding internship selection.

## Project Overview

Aim: 
- Create a stateful widget which has a container and a background color
- Store the background color in a state variable in this container
- Generate the background color as a random color in initState of container instead of passing it down as
props. 
- From a parent widget have an array of such containers and render them in a row, note that the array
should contain widgets and not the colors.
- Have a button in parent widget, on click of the button the containers should be swapped.
